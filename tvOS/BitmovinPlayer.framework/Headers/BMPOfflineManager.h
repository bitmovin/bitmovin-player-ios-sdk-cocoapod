/**
 * IMPORTANT: Methods from BMPOfflineManager need to be called from the main thread.
 *
 * This class offers functionality to handle the whole lifecycle of protected and unprotected offline content. Do not
 * create own instances of it, instead use [OfflineManager sharedInstance] to obtain a reference to the singleton.
 *
 * Depending on the current state of the SourceItem, which can be obtained by calling offlineStateForSourceItem:,
 * different methods are allowed to be called on the BMPOfflineManager. The table below shows all possible and allowed
 * transitions between the different states. Each line describes one transition which happens immediately and synchronous.
 * When there is a method call noted in column "Method call triggering transition", the "Following State" is entered
 * immediately after the method call returns.
 *
 * When there is no method call noted, the "Following State" is entered when the event described in column
 * "BMPOfflineManagerListener event" was received.
 *
 * The "Following State" is always noted under the assumption that no error occurred when calling the transition method,
 * or during processing of the current task. Errors are always reported to offlineManager:didFailWithError:. See the
 * documentation of BMPOfflineManagerListener.h for more information.
 *
